# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Django Docker Setup
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Set up a Django 5.0+ project with Docker Compose configuration for local development, including PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, and development environment optimized for the MCP Method Hub SaaS platform. This foundation will support user authentication, MCP server integration, and scalable deployment to AWS infrastructure.

## User Stories

### Developer Environment Setup

As a developer, I want to set up the complete development environment with a single command, so that I can start contributing to the project immediately without complex configuration.

The developer should be able to run `docker-compose up` and have a fully functional Django application with database, caching, and all dependencies ready for development, including hot-reload capabilities for efficient coding.

### Database Development Workflow

As a developer, I want to work with PostgreSQL in development that matches production, so that I can avoid database-specific issues and test features accurately.

The development environment should include PostgreSQL 17+ with proper user permissions, database initialization, and volume persistence that allows for data retention between container restarts while supporting Django migrations and fixtures.

### Production Parity

As a developer, I want the local environment to closely mirror production infrastructure, so that deployments are predictable and environment-specific bugs are minimized.

The Docker setup should use similar base images, environment configuration patterns, and service architecture that will be used in AWS ECS deployment, including proper secrets management and container networking.

## Spec Scope

1. **Django Project Structure** - Create Django 5.0+ project with proper app organization and settings configuration
2. **Docker Compose Configuration** - Multi-service setup with Django app, PostgreSQL, Redis, and development optimizations
3. **Database Setup** - PostgreSQL 17+ container with initialization scripts and volume persistence
4. **Development Environment** - Hot-reload, debug settings, and development-friendly configurations
5. **Environment Configuration** - Proper secrets management and environment-specific settings using .env files

## Out of Scope

- AWS deployment configuration (will be handled in later phases)
- Production Docker images and security hardening
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- SSL certificates and domain configuration
- Backup and monitoring solutions

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional Django application accessible at http://localhost:8000 with admin panel working
2. PostgreSQL database accessible and properly configured with Django ORM
3. Redis cache service running and available for Django sessions and caching
