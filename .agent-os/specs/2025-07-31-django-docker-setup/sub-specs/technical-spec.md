# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-31-django-docker-setup/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- Django 5.0+ project structure with proper settings organization (development, production, base)
- Docker Compose configuration with services: web (Django), db (PostgreSQL), redis (Redis), nginx (reverse proxy)
- PostgreSQL 17+ container with named volumes for data persistence and proper user/database initialization
- Redis latest stable container for session storage and caching backend
- Python 3.12-slim base image for Django container with proper non-root user setup
- Volume mounts for source code to enable hot-reload during development
- Environment variable configuration using .env files for secrets and settings
- Django settings configured for Docker networking with proper database and cache connections
- Pre-commit hooks setup with Black, Ruff, and mypy for code quality
- Requirements management using pip-tools with separate dev and production requirements
- Docker health checks for all services to ensure proper startup ordering
- Proper Django project structure with apps directory and core configuration
- Database migration automation on container startup
- Static file serving configuration using Whitenoise for development
- Django admin user creation script for initial setup

## External Dependencies

- **Docker** - Container orchestration for local development
- **Justification:** Required for consistent development environment and production parity

- **docker-compose** - Multi-container application management
- **Justification:** Simplifies local development by managing multiple services (Django, PostgreSQL, Redis)

- **pip-tools** - Python dependency management
- **Justification:** Ensures reproducible builds with locked dependency versions
