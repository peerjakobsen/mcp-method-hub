## 2025-07-31: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build MCP Method Hub as a SaaS platform for testing productivity methodology MCP servers. The product will target professionals seeking to improve their productivity by allowing them to test-drive implementations of popular methodologies (GTD, EOS, Atomic Habits) before integrating them into their existing tool stack (Slack, Teams, M365, Asana, Jira). Initial development focuses on the SaaS website infrastructure without implementing the actual MCP servers.

### Context

The productivity tools market is fragmented, with professionals using 5-10 different tools daily. While many are aware of proven methodologies from popular books, implementing these systems across their existing tools is complex and risky. There's a clear gap in the market for a solution that allows professionals to experience these methodologies hands-on before committing to implementation. MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide a unique technical approach to deliver these methodologies as integrable services.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional SaaS Productivity App**
   - Pros: Complete control over user experience, simpler implementation
   - Cons: Adds another tool to users' stack, high switching costs, competes with established players

2. **Browser Extension Marketplace**
   - Pros: Direct integration with web-based tools, easier distribution
   - Cons: Limited functionality, security concerns, platform-specific development

3. **API-First Integration Platform**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, enterprise-friendly
   - Cons: Higher technical barrier for users, longer sales cycles

### Rationale

MCP servers offer a unique value proposition by providing a standardized way to package and distribute productivity methodologies. The sandbox approach reduces adoption risk, while the integration preview feature addresses the primary pain point of implementation complexity. Starting with the SaaS infrastructure allows us to validate the market need before investing in complex MCP server development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear differentiation in the productivity tools market
- Scalable approach to adding new methodologies
- Low-risk trial experience increases adoption likelihood
- Platform approach enables community contributions

**Negative:**
- Requires education about MCP technology
- Dependency on MCP ecosystem maturity
- Initial development complexity for sandbox environment
- Need to maintain multiple integration previews
