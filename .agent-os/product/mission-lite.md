# Product Mission (Lite)

MCP Method Hub is a SaaS platform that helps professionals test and experience productivity methodologies through MCP servers before integrating them into their existing workflow tools.

MCP Method Hub serves knowledge workers, team leaders, and productivity enthusiasts who want to implement proven productivity systems without the risk of failed adoption. Unlike traditional books or courses, we provide interactive MCP servers that demonstrate exactly how methodologies like GTD, EOS, and Atomic Habits work within users' existing tools like Slack, Teams, and Jira, increasing adoption success rates by 3x.
